# Hangman

Welcome to Hangman. This is a play on the classic game of trying to guess a word or phrase before you are hanged.

## Getting Started

This runs on straight Ruby, so no gems or additional files required.

## Playing the Game

At the start you will be prompted to enter a user name, and select if you want to guess a single word or a phrase. Follow the directions to guess the correct answer before you are hanged!

## Tests

Run the environment.rb file in your terminal to begin the game.

## Built With

Standard Ruby
